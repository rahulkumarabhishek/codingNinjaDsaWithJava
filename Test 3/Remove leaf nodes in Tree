/*Remove leaf nodes in Tree
Send Feedback
Remove all leaf nodes from a given generic Tree. Leaf nodes are those nodes, which don't have any children.
Note : Root will also be a leaf node if it doesn't have any child. You don't need to print the tree, just remove all leaf nodes and return the updated root.
Input format :
Line 1 : Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - `

Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element `
Output Format :
Elements are printed level wise, each level in new line (separated by space)
Sample Input 1 :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output 1 : (Level wise, each level in new line)
10
